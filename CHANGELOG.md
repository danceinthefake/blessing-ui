# Changelog

## 0.1.0 — 2026-09-27

First public release.

- 144 Vue 3 components styled only through `--bless-*` custom properties, with `tokens.css` usable on its own
- Native platform first: `<dialog>`, Popover API, `<details>`, native form controls, `Intl` dates
- Accessible defaults, checked with axe on every docs page in light and dark themes, and end-to-end in Chromium, Firefox and WebKit
- ESM and tree-shakable, with CSS split per component; `vue` is the only required peer (`@tiptap/vue-3` optional, for `BlessEditor`)
- 16 copy-in blocks (sign in, dashboard, inbox, chat, settings and more) in the docs at [ui.blessing.id](https://ui.blessing.id)
